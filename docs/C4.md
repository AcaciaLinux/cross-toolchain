# Chapter 4 documentation

The Chapter 4 of the LFS book starts by creating a new filesystem in a special directory that will represent the root (/) of the system that gets built in the next steps.

# Preparations

- A directory for the new root (/)

- **LFS** variable

### root directory

To build the acacia cross compiler toolchain you will need a new directory for building the new system in.

### LFS Variable

The LFS environment variable is a variable that gets used by most of the scripts up until the chrooting happens. This specifies the directory the new system gets built in. This is the directory you previously created.

# Running

To run this scripts, just call the script with `root` priveleges, the rest gets made automatically, including creating a new basic limited filesystem, copying this scripts directory into the `$LFS/scripts` directory for later access, creating a new user called `lfs` that does have very little rights on the system to not brick te host and `su`s into it.
