# Chapter 7 documentation

The Chapter 7 of the LFS book chroots into the newly built system and compiles some additional tools.

# Preparations

- **LFS** variable

**If you are coming from the C4.sh script and are logged in as the `lfs` user, these variables will be set for you in your .bashrc**

### LFS Variable

The LFS environment variable is a variable that gets used by most of the scripts up until the chrooting happens. This specifies the directory the new system gets built in.

## Downloading the sources

Before running the main script, you will have to run the `C6/00.1_download.sh` script to download the necessary sources because the new system does not have any way of downloading new sources.

## Chrooting and preparing the chroot

Once the sources have been downloaded you can chroot into the new system using the `C7/01_enter_chroot.sh` script **with `root` priveleges**.

Navigate to the scripts folder which is now located at `/scripts`.

Then you will have to set up some additional filesystem pieces by executing the `C7/02_chroot_prep.sh` script.

# Running

The **LFS** variable is not set anymore because we you now root and you don't even need it anymore, this is your new system.

 You can use the script `C7/00.2_build_C7.sh` that will run all the other scripts and logs their output into a directory: `$LFS/buildLogs/C7`.
