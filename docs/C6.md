# Chapter 6 documentation

The Chapter 6 of the LFS book builds some cross compiled tools to completely decouple the new system from the old one

# Preparations

- **LFS** variable

- **LFS_SOURCES** variable

- **LFS_BUILDS** variable

- **LFS_TGT** variable

**If you are coming from the C4.sh script and are logged in as the `lfs` user, these variables will be set for you in your .bashrc**

### LFS Variable

The LFS environment variable is a variable that gets used by most of the scripts up until the chrooting happens. This specifies the directory the new system gets built in.

### LFS_SOURCES Variable

This variable provides the directory where the Chapter 5 scripts can put their downloaded sources.

**This directory does not have to exist, `C5/01_prep.sh` will create it**

### LFS_BUILDS Variable

This is a directory used for compiling the packages, this is totally temporary because it is not used anymore after the installation of the tools.

**This directory does not have to exist, `C5/01_prep.sh` will create it**

### LFS_TGT Variable

This is the compiler prefix, this too is set in your `.bashrc` if you used `C4.sh` to come to this stage.

# Running

You can use the script `C6/00_build_C6.sh` that will run all the other scripts and logs their output into a directory: `$LFS/buildLogs/C6`.

**Make sure you run this scripts as the `lfs` user, unless it can damage your current system!**

## Note

The source packages are downloaded automatically, so make sure you are connected to the internet while building Chapter 6!
